It is a global practicing community that fosters learning and friendly competition, built on top of the worldâ€™s 
largest competitive programming platform. We have also built a large community of problem curators. Through this what

Through this website we have taken the big initiative to educate the children.Generally the students from poor background do 
not get the enough study material to secure a good rank in exams,so through this website we can irradicate this problem
