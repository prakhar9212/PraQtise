<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 30px">
The All India Pre-Medical test/ Pre-Dental Entrance Test (AIPMT now replaced by NEET-UG)[1] was an annual medical entrance examination in India.[2] The exam was conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Delhi for admission to MBBS and BDS courses in several medical colleges across the country. 15% of the total seats in all medical and dental colleges run by the Union of India, state governments, municipal or other local authorities in India, except in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Jammu and Kashmir, were reserved for candidates who qualified this examination.

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 30px" > The primary aim of this test, which was standardized all over India, was to make medical education available on an equitable basis to all regions of the nation and to foster inter-regional exchange. Until 2006, the AIPMT was unusual as it was one of the few all-India competitive examinations (along with the examinations for the defense services) based completely on merit and without any reservations. However, from 2006, under pressure from the Human Resources ministry headed by Arjun Singh, reservation for OBC has also been introduced in AIPMT.
    Every Year AIPMT was conducted on first Sunday in the month of May.In 2016, AIPMT/NEET Phase-1 was conducted on 1 May 2016 and NEET Phase-2 was conducted on 24 July 2016.</p>
<br><br>

The exam duration was 3 hours. Each question carried 4 marks. For each incorrect response, one mark used to be deducted from the total score. However, no deduction from the total score was made if no response was indicated for an item. Indication of more than one answer for a question was deemed an incorrect response and negatively marked.</p>
